# Notemd Documentation

This directory contains the Docusaurus-based documentation site for Notemd.

## Architecture

- **Docusaurus 3.10.1** with GitHub Pages deployment
- **Automatic JSON-LD injection** via swizzled `DocItem/Layout`
- **Published locales**: English (`en`) plus full docs routes for Simplified Chinese (`zh-CN`), Traditional Chinese (`zh-Hant`), Traditional Chinese for Taiwan (`zh-TW`), Japanese (`ja`), French (`fr`), German (`de`), Spanish (`es`), Korean (`ko`), Italian (`it`), Portuguese (`pt`), Brazilian Portuguese (`pt-BR`), Russian (`ru`), Arabic (`ar`), Persian (`fa`), Hindi (`hi`), Bengali (`bn`), Dutch (`nl`), Swedish (`sv`), Finnish (`fi`), Danish (`da`), Norwegian (`no`), Polish (`pl`), Turkish (`tr`), Hebrew (`he`), Thai (`th`), Greek (`el`), Czech (`cs`), Hungarian (`hu`), Romanian (`ro`), Ukrainian (`uk`), Vietnamese (`vi`), Indonesian (`id`), and Malay (`ms`)
- **AI-readable structure**: TLDR components, FAQPage Schema, TechArticle Schema, citations, concept metadata, and `llms.txt`

## Local Development

```bash
cd website
npm install
npm start
```

This starts a local development server at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Build

```bash
npm run build
npm run audit:build
```

The build generates static content into `build`. The audit checks the public contract that source review cannot prove by itself:

- root and localized root pages exist;
- canonical and JSON-LD URLs match GitHub Pages routes;
- homepage GEO text, `llms.txt` link, release version, and multilingual route boundary are present on localized homepages;
- every published localized docs locale mirrors the English source MDX route set;
- the legacy route inventory in `publishedLanguageScopeData.mjs` stays aligned with the source docs consumed by older GEO gates;
- published localized docs are indexable and expose correct alternates;
- the old unpublished zh-CN fallback path is retired because the docs route set is now localized end-to-end;
- English docs expose locale alternates for the full published docs route set;
- Provider docs contain setup, endpoint/auth, model discovery, troubleshooting, and use-case sections;
- `llms.txt` states the real multilingual route boundary;
- GEO measurement docs mention Search Console, AI visibility, and sitemap evidence.

## Deployment

The site auto-deploys to GitHub Pages on push to `main` via `.github/workflows/deploy-docs.yml`. The deployment workflow runs both `npm run build` and `npm run audit:build` before uploading the Pages artifact.

### 2026-07-02 Pages CI Triage

The historical remote failure investigated on 2026-07-02 was not a Docusaurus source failure. Run `27451762938` failed during `actions/deploy-pages@v4` with `HttpError: Not Found` and GitHub's instruction to enable Pages. Later `main` Pages deploys succeeded, so the active repository gate remains the build plus audit pair in this workflow.

When `website/**` or `.github/workflows/deploy-docs.yml` changes, treat the next Pages run as the source of truth and verify both jobs:

```bash
npm run build
npm run audit:build
```

## GEO Features

### 1. Global JSON-LD Schema

- `docusaurus.config.js`: WebSite + SoftwareApplication schema in `headTags`
- Automatically injected on all pages

### 2. Per-Page TechArticle Schema

- `src/theme/DocItem/Layout/index.js`: swizzled layout component
- Auto-generates TechArticle schema from frontmatter
- Keeps TechArticle metadata aligned across localized docs
- Supports author, keywords, concepts, citations

### 3. Language Signal Ownership

- `website/src/lib/publishedLocales.mjs`: the single source of truth for Docusaurus locale codes, labels, `htmlLang`, text direction, and the public language-scope sentence
- `website/src/lib/publishedLanguageScopeData.mjs`: published doc ids, route paths, source paths, homepage paths, and critical paths consumed by legacy zh-CN GEO gates
- `website/src/lib/publishedLanguageScope.js`: runtime set helpers derived from the data file
- `website/src/lib/languageRoutePolicy.js`: route policy helpers for doc path extraction, locale-prefix stripping, canonical English targets, and zh-CN compatibility helpers

### 4. Docusaurus Theme Policy Overrides

- `src/theme/SiteMetadata/index.js`: owns hreflang and Open Graph locale alternate emission
- `src/theme/NavbarItem/LocaleDropdownNavbarItem/index.js`: keeps locale switching on same-domain routes
- `src/theme/DocRoot/Layout/Sidebar/index.js`: preserves the historical zh-CN published-doc filter, which is now full-route because every docs page is published
- `src/theme/DocItem/Paginator/index.js`: preserves the historical zh-CN previous/next filter, which is now full-route because every docs page is published

These overrides are intentionally policy-bearing. Do not replace them with a generic wrapper layer unless the new abstraction owns the same invariant.

### 5. Root Homepage for GitHub Pages

- `src/pages/index.js`: real root route for `/obsidian-NotEMD/` and every localized root path
- Prevents navbar/logo/footer root links from pointing to a missing page
- Routes readers and crawlers to Intro, Quick Start, FAQ, provider docs, and the AI knowledge pillar
- Owns visible GEO facts that answer engines and humans should see first: write-first workflow model, provider surface, local-vault boundary, current release, answer-engine source map, and multilingual docs route boundary

### 6. AI Retrieval Entry Point

- `static/llms.txt`: high-signal canonical map for AI crawlers and answer engines
- Lists canonical docs, provider/runtime topics, localized docs entrypoints, and the multilingual route boundary
- Keeps GEO strategy focused on verified source pages while exposing localized docs routes for supported languages

### 7. Build Output Language Gate

- `website/scripts/audit-build.cjs`: blocks Pages deployment when build output violates the language/GEO contract
- Checks real generated HTML, homepage GEO copy, current release version, sitemaps, `llms.txt`, provider docs, source scope, and measurement evidence

### 8. FAQ with FAQPage Schema

- `docs/faq.mdx`: English FAQ
- `i18n/<locale>/docusaurus-plugin-content-docs/current/faq.mdx`: localized FAQ for every published documentation locale
- The swizzled doc layout emits FAQPage schema for FAQ docs

## Adding New Languages

1. Add locale metadata to `src/lib/publishedLocales.mjs`.
2. Run or update `node scripts/generate-localized-docs.cjs`.
3. Translate content in `i18n/<locale>/docusaurus-plugin-content-docs/current/`.
4. Translate navbar, footer, and docs sidebar messages under `i18n/<locale>/`.
5. Build and audit the site before publishing the locale.

## Language Publishing Policy

Do not add a locale to `i18n.locales` just because a translation folder exists. The supported policy is now full docs-route publication: every source page under `website/docs/` must have a localized counterpart before the locale appears in the public language dropdown.

Current policy: English remains the canonical source surface, and every README/UI locale declared in `src/lib/publishedLocales.mjs` exposes the complete docs route set: Simplified Chinese (`zh-CN`), Traditional Chinese (`zh-Hant`), Traditional Chinese for Taiwan (`zh-TW`), Japanese (`ja`), French (`fr`), German (`de`), Spanish (`es`), Korean (`ko`), Italian (`it`), Portuguese (`pt`), Brazilian Portuguese (`pt-BR`), Russian (`ru`), Arabic (`ar`), Persian (`fa`), Hindi (`hi`), Bengali (`bn`), Dutch (`nl`), Swedish (`sv`), Finnish (`fi`), Danish (`da`), Norwegian (`no`), Polish (`pl`), Turkish (`tr`), Hebrew (`he`), Thai (`th`), Greek (`el`), Czech (`cs`), Hungarian (`hu`), Romanian (`ro`), Ukrainian (`uk`), Vietnamese (`vi`), Indonesian (`id`), and Malay (`ms`). Provider names, CLI commands, configuration keys, file extensions, and package names intentionally remain stable across languages so users can match documentation to the plugin UI, CLI output, and logs.

`website/src/lib/publishedLanguageScopeData.mjs` still exists because older GEO gates and zh-CN theme overrides consume it, but it now declares the full docs route set rather than a partial-publishing allowlist. `website/src/lib/publishedLocales.mjs` owns the public language matrix used by Docusaurus, the docs generator, and the build audit. When adding or removing docs pages or locales, update the matching source file and rerun:

```bash
npm run build
npm run audit:build
```

After deployment, record Search Console and AI visibility observations in `docs/maintainer/github-pages-geo-measurement-log.md`.

## Homepage GEO Sync Constraint

Public GEO or product-positioning changes are not complete unless they are visible on the project website. In the same change, update:

1. `website/src/pages/index.js` for visible homepage facts, source-map links, and language-boundary wording.
2. `website/docusaurus.config.js` for global JSON-LD and current release metadata.
3. `website/static/llms.txt` for answer-engine route mapping and the same language boundary.
4. `website/scripts/audit-build.cjs` so future builds fail when those surfaces drift.
5. `GEO_ROADMAP.md` and `docs/maintainer/github-pages-geo-measurement-log*.md` for dated source-side evidence and post-deploy measurement scope.

Do not ship a GEO update that only changes maintainer documentation. The homepage, `llms.txt`, sitemap/hreflang behavior, and JSON-LD must describe the same product and language truth before Pages deployment.
